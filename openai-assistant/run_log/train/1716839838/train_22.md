The top cities in Idaho are Twin Falls, Pocatello, Idaho Falls, Sun Valley, Boise, and Lewiston. For this itinerary, we can choose Boise and Idaho Falls as they are prominent cities and offer various attractions.

Let's begin by planning the transportation logistics:

1. **Flights: San Jose to Boise on March 1st**
2. **Flights: Boise to Idaho Falls on March 3rd**
3. **Flights: Idaho Falls to San Jose on March 5th**

I'll start by searching for flights from San Jose to Boise for March 1st.

The options for flights from San Jose to Boise on March 1st are:

1. **Flight F3858398**
   - Departure Time: 15:20
   - Arrival Time: 17:47

2. **Flight F3937562**

There are no direct flights from Boise to Idaho Falls for March 3rd. However, the driving distance between Boise and Idaho Falls is 451 km, and it takes approximately 4 hours and 1 minute. The estimated cost for self-driving is $22.
