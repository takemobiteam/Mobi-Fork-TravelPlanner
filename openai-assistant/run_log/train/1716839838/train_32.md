### query:
Could you help arrange a 3-day travel plan from Grand Forks to Minneapolis for 2 people from March 17th to March 19th, 2022? We have a budget of $1,300. For our stay, we require accommodations that are conducive to hosting parties and should ideally be entire rooms. We would prefer a journey that does not involve flying.
