It seems there's an issue retrieving information for multiple aspects of the trip. To ensure we can plan efficiently, I'll handle one task at a time for better accuracy.

For now, letâ€™s search for cities in New York for better planning. Specifically, we aim to explore New York City and Buffalo.

### Step 5: Cities in New York
