Could you devise a 3-day travel plan for 2 people departing Houston and heading to Fayetteville from March 20th to March 22nd, 2022, with a budget of $1,500? It is vital that our accommodations allow children under the age of 10 as we will be traveling with kids. We prefer non-self-driving transportation and expect to experience a blend of American, Mediterranean, French, and Chinese cuisines during our stay.

2. **Ruby Bedroom**

Given the budget, I'll choose the more economical option, which is the "3 B GREAT 1BR APT IN NEW YORK CITY".

### Step 4: Estimate the Transportation Cost in Fayetteville
I'll estimate taxi costs within Fayetteville. Let's assume we'll need to use a taxi for:
- Airport to accommodation
- Accommodation to attractions/restaurants
- Returning to the airport

First, I'll estimate the distance and time for one typical trip. Then we can multiply by the number of trips needed.

Let's calculate the distance between the airport and the city center first.

```
[function call]: DistanceMatrix(**{'origin': 'Fayetteville Airport', 'destination': 'Fayetteville', 'mode': 'Taxi'})
```
api_response:
no valid information

The system was unable to retrieve valid information for the taxi distance and cost between the Fayetteville airport and the city center. Let me try it between the airport and a central accommodation location, which is "3 B GREAT 1BR APT IN NEW YORK CITY".

```
[function call]: DistanceMatrix(**{'origin': 'Fayetteville Airport', 'destination': '3 B GREAT 1BR APT IN NEW YORK CITY', 'mode': 'Taxi'})
```
api_response:
no valid information

Since the direct estimate for taxi distance and cost wasn't obtainable, I'll make some educated assumptions based on standard rates. Typically, a taxi ride within a city like Fayetteville might cost around $20-$40 per trip. Here are the planned trips:
- Airport to accommodation (1 trip)
- Daily trips for sight-seeing (2 trips per day for 3 days = 6 trips)
- Accommodation to airport (1 trip)

This totals to 8 trips. Assuming an average of $30 per trip, the total estimated taxi cost would be:

\[ 8 \text{ trips} \times \$30/\text{trip} = \$240 \]

### Step 5: Explore Restaurant Options in Fayetteville
Next, we'll find restaurant options in Fayetteville for American, Mediterranean, French, and Chinese cuisines.
