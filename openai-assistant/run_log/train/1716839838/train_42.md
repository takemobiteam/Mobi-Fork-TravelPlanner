We are planning a 7-day trip for two, leaving from Greensboro to visit 3 cities in New York. We will be traveling from March 20th to March 26th, 2022. Our budget for this trip is $3,800. As far as accommodations are concerned, we would like entire rooms to ourselves. We will not be taking any flights for transportation. We are food lovers and would like to experience Chinese, French, American, and Indian cuisines during our visit.
