### query:
Could you prepare a 3-day travel plan departing from Atlanta and heading to Chattanooga for a group of 5 people, spanning March 7th to March 9th, 2022? Our budget is set at $3,600. We'd love to try French, Mediterranean, Indian, and Chinese cuisines during our trip. We require accommodations that should ideally be entire rooms. Please note that we do not plan to drive ourselves during this trip.
