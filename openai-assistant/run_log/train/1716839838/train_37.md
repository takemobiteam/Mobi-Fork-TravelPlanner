Can you assist in creating a 5-day travel itinerary starting in Sacramento and covering 2 cities in Washington state from March 22nd to March 26th, 2022? The journey will be for a group of three with a budget of $3,600. We require accommodations that provide entire rooms and do not plan to travel by flight. As far as cuisines are concerned, we'd love to experience American, Mediterranean, Italian, and French during our trip.
