### Summary of the Itinerary and Budget Calculation

#### Expenditure Overview:
- **Flights:** $558
- **Accommodation:** $552
- **Meals:** $360
- **Total:** $1470

We are currently over budget. Therefore, we need to adjust our plans to stay within the $1,100 budget. Our main area to adjust will be the accommodation and food.

### Adjusted Accommodation Plan
We'll need to choose a cheaper accommodation option that is feasible. Let's re-evaluate the options, prioritizing the budget.

### Step 5: Re-evaluate Accommodation Choices
Given our budget constraints for 3 days, reconsidering cheap hostels or budget hotels seems necessary, given the prices provided earlier are too high. 

Since we might need to renegotiate the accommodation, meal costs, or find some lodging like AirBnBs with lower and waived charges.

Let's plan out the days factoring in just our transport, meals and then summarize after searching/re-evaluating lodging again. 

---

### Adjust Summary Plan: Example

#### Day 1:
- **Current City:** Travel from Fort Lauderdale to Milwaukee
- **Transportation:** Flight Number: F3997865 from Fort Lauderdale to Milwaukee; Departs at 17:19 arrives at 19:20
- **Breakfast:** On Board/Applied Meals
- **Lunch:** Subway, Milwaukee
- **Dinner:** The Chinese Kitchen, Milwaukee
- **Accommodation:** To Be Reevaluated to cheaper options within Budget

#### Day 2:
- **Current City:** Milwaukee 
- **Breakfast:** Ramesh Vaishno Dhaba
- **Attraction:** Pending Attraction Search to find affordable visits 
- **Lunch:** Kumaon Dhaba & Service
- **Dinner:** Funduz Cafe
- **Accommodation:** Same as above 

We need to re-evaluate using any single cheaper  alternative tool set. This is now an adequate action/summary logic till we summarize it incrementally below after fixing lodging etc.
