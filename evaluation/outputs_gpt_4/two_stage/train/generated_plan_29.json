I should identify which cities in Michigan we'll be stopping at. Once the cities are selected, I can look for flights, accommodations, dining options, and attractions in those cities. I also need to keep the budget in mind when making selections.

Now, I need to find transportation options from Louisville to Detroit, then to Grand Rapids, and finally to Traverse City.
