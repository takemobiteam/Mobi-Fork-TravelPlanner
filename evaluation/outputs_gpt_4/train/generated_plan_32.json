After that, I should look for pet-friendly accommodations in Washington. Then, I'll search for restaurants and attractions in the city. Since the group won't be self-driving, I'll need to find out the transportation options and costs between the airport, hotel, and attractions using a taxi service.

After that, I'll use the GoogleDistanceMatrix to estimate taxi costs for transportation within the city. Once all the information is gathered, I will compile it into the Notebook.\nAction 5: NotebookWrite[Pet-friendly accommodation options in Washington]\nObservation 5: The information has been recorded in Notebook, and its index is 1.\nThought 6: Thought 6: With the accommodation options recorded, the next step is to find dining options in Washington that can accommodate a group of 3 people. After that, I will search for attractions that the group might be interested in visiting during their stay. It's important to consider a variety of dining and attraction options to cater to different tastes and interests. Once I have this information, I will estimate taxi transportation costs for getting around the city.\nAction 6: RestaurantSearch[Washington]\nObservation 6: Masked due to limited length. Make sure the data has been written in Notebook.\nThought 7: Thought 7: The restaurant options in Washington offer a variety of cuisines and average costs that should fit the group's dining preferences and budget. I should note these options in the Notebook. Next, I will search for attractions in Washington that the group can visit during their stay. After gathering the attraction information, I will estimate the taxi transportation costs using the GoogleDistanceMatrix tool for the necessary routes. Once all the information is compiled, I can use the Planner tool to create the travel plan.\nAction 7: NotebookWrite[Restaurant options in Washington]\nObservation 7: The information has been recorded in Notebook, and its index is 2.\nThought 8: Thought 8: Now that I have the dining options noted, I need to find attractions in Washington that the group can enjoy. I should look for a mix of historical, cultural, and leisure attractions to provide a well-rounded experience. After I have a list of attractions, I will use the GoogleDistanceMatrix to estimate taxi costs for transportation between the airport, hotel, and these attractions. This will help ensure that the transportation expenses stay within the group's budget. Once I have all this information, I can compile it into the Notebook and then use the Planner tool to create the final travel plan.\nAction 8: AttractionSearch[Washington]\nObservation 8: Masked due to limited length.

Once I have all the necessary information, I can compile it into the Notebook and then use the Planner tool to create the final travel plan.\nAction 9: NotebookWrite[Attraction options in Washington]\nObservation 9: The information has been recorded in Notebook, and its index is 3.\nThought 10: Thought 10: With the attractions recorded, the final piece of information I need before creating the travel plan is the estimated taxi costs for transportation between the airport, hotel, and attractions. This will help me ensure that the group's transportation expenses are within their budget. I will use the GoogleDistanceMatrix tool to find out the taxi costs for these routes. Once I have this information, I will add it to the Notebook and then use the Planner tool to generate the complete 3-day travel plan for the group.\nAction 10: GoogleDistanceMatrix[Washington Dulles International Airport, Stunning 2Bed/2BA + 300sqft deck by the river!, taxi]\nObservation 10: Masked due to limited length. Make sure the data has been written in Notebook.\nThought 11: Thought 11: Since I did not receive valid information for the taxi cost from Washington Dulles International Airport to the accommodation, I should try again, possibly with a different accommodation or airport if necessary. It's important to have accurate cost estimates for transportation to ensure the total budget is adhered to. Once I have this information, I can proceed to estimate taxi costs to the attractions from the accommodation.\nAction 11: GoogleDistanceMatrix[Washington Dulles International Airport, Washington, taxi]\nObservation 11: Masked due to limited length. Make sure the data has been written in Notebook.\nThought 12: Thought 12: It seems there is an issue with obtaining taxi cost information from Washington Dulles International Airport to the accommodation and the city. I may need to consider a different airport or check if there's a problem with the tool. However, I can still estimate taxi costs within the city, from the accommodation to various attractions. This will give me an idea of the transportation budget required for the group's daily activities. Once I have this information, I can add it to the Notebook and then use the Planner tool to generate the complete 3-day travel plan for the group.\nAction 12: GoogleDistanceMatrix[Stunning 2Bed/2BA + 300sqft deck by the river!, National Mall, taxi]\nObservation 12: Masked due to limited length. Make sure the data has been written in Notebook.\nThought 13: Thought 13: It appears that I'm unable to obtain taxi cost information using the GoogleDistanceMatrix tool for specific addresses or attractions. To work around this, I should try using broader locations, such as the city center or general areas within Washington, to estimate taxi costs. This should provide a general idea of transportation expenses within the city. Once I have a rough estimate of taxi costs for a few key routes, I can record this information in the Notebook. Afterward, I can use the Planner tool to create the travel plan, taking into account the budget and the need for pet-friendly accommodations.\nAction 13: GoogleDistanceMatrix[Washington, National Mall, taxi]\nObservation 13: Masked due to limited length. Make sure the data has been written in Notebook.\nThought 14: Thought 14: It seems that obtaining specific taxi cost information for Washington is not possible at the moment. However, I have gathered information on flights, accommodations, restaurants, and attractions. I will proceed with the information I have and make a note in the Notebook about the lack of specific taxi cost data. The Planner tool can then be used to create a travel plan with the available information, and I will include a note for the travelers to budget for taxi costs separately, based on average rates in the city. This will allow the group to have a complete itinerary while still being mindful of their transportation budget.\nAction 14: NotebookWrite[Lack of specific taxi cost data]\nObservation 14: The information has been recorded in Notebook, and its index is 4.\nThought 15: Thought 15: Now that I have recorded all the available information in the Notebook, including flights, accommodations, restaurants, attractions, and a note on the lack of specific taxi cost data, I am ready to use the Planner tool. The Planner will create a 3-day travel plan for the group of 3 people, taking into account their preferences for pet-friendly accommodations, the desire for entire rooms, and their budget of $3,100. The plan will need to be mindful of transportation costs, which will be estimated based on average city rates due to the lack of specific data. Once the Planner tool generates the travel plan, I can review it to ensure it meets the group's needs and make any necessary adjustments before finalizing the itinerary.\nAction 15: Planner[Generate a 3-day travel plan for a group of 3 people, departing from Bangor and visiting Washington from March 21st to March 23rd, 2022, with a budget of $3,100, requiring pet-friendly accommodations and entire rooms, not planning on self-driving]\nObservation 15: Travel Plan:\n\nDay 1: March 21, 2022\nCurrent City: from Bangor to Washington\nTransportation: Flight Number: F3787709, from Bangor to Washington, Departure Time: 05:38, Arrival Time: 07:22\nBreakfast: - (Assuming breakfast will be on the flight or before departure)\nAttraction: The Seattle Great Wheel, Address: 1301 Alaskan Wy, Seattle, WA 98101, USA\nLunch: Los Aztecas, Average Cost: $46, Cuisines: Cafe, Bakery, BBQ, Fast Food\nDinner: Hemingway's Island Grill, Average Cost: $57, Cuisines: Mexican, BBQ, Fast Food, Cafe, Seafood\nAccommodation: Beautifully Renovated 3BD/2BA \u2606 1 Block to Subway, Price: $1,170 (for 3 nights, entire home/apt, pet-friendly)\n\nDay 2: March 22, 2022\nCurrent City: Washington\nTransportation: Taxi (No specific cost data, but within budget constraints)\nBreakfast: Manna Java World Cafe, Average Cost: $59, Cuisines: Cafe, Seafood\nAttraction 1: Space Needle, Address: 400 Broad St, Seattle, WA 98109, USA\nAttraction 2: Chihuly Garden and Glass, Address: 305 Harrison St, Seattle, WA 98109, USA\nLunch: Thaaliwala, Average Cost: $88, Cuisines: Tea, Pizza, Italian, BBQ, Cafe\nDinner: Republic of Chicken, Average Cost: $91, Cuisines: Tea, Bakery, American, Desserts\nAccommodation: Beautifully Renovated 3BD/2BA \u2606 1 Block to Subway\n\nDay 3: March 23, 2022\nCurrent City: Washington\nTransportation: Taxi (No specific cost data, but within budget constraints)\nBreakfast: Good Foods, Average Cost: $65, Cuisines: BBQ, Desserts, Seafood\nAttraction: Olympic National Park, Address: 3002 Mt Angeles Rd, Port Angeles, WA 98362, USA\nLunch: Shiv Dhaba, Average Cost: $61, Cuisines: Bakery, American, Cafe, Seafood\nDinner: Amaze Dining, Average Cost: $92, Cuisines: Cafe, Pizza, American, Fast Food\nAccommodation: -\n\nNote: The budget for flights, accommodation, and meals is calculated within the $3,100 limit.
