Since the clients prefer non-self-driving transportation, I'll focus on taxi services for in-city travel. I must also ensure that the accommodations are child-friendly and that the total cost remains within the $1,500 budget.\nObservation 1: Invalid Action. Valid Actions are  FlightSearch[Departure City, Destination City, Date] / AccommodationSearch[City] /  RestaurantSearch[City] / NotebookWrite[Short Description] / AttractionSearch[City] / CitySearch[State] / GoogleDistanceMatrix[Origin, Destination, Mode] and Planner[Query].\nThought 2: Thought 2: To begin, I should find flights from Houston to Fayetteville for the specified dates. Next, I'll search for child-friendly accommodations in Fayetteville. Following that, I'll look for restaurants that serve American, Mediterranean, French, and Chinese cuisines. I'll also search for attractions suitable for a family with children. Finally, I'll estimate the taxi fare for transportation within Fayetteville. All this information will be written into the Notebook to be used by the Planner tool.\nAction 2: Action 2: FlightSearch[Houston, Fayetteville, 2022-03-20]\nObservation 2: Invalid Action.

Fayetteville could refer to multiple locations in different states. I need to determine which Fayetteville the clients are referring to before I can proceed with the flight search. Since the state was not specified, I will assume it is Fayetteville, Arkansas, as it is one of the more well-known cities named Fayetteville. Now, I will perform the correct flight search action.\nAction 3: Action 3: FlightSearch[Houston, Fayetteville, 2023-03-20]\nObservation 3: Invalid Action.

Since there are multiple Fayettevilles in the United States, I need to specify the state to ensure accurate flight search results. I will assume the state is Arkansas, as it is a common destination.
