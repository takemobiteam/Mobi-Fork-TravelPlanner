Once the cities are chosen, I can look for flights from Greer to the first city in Pennsylvania, then find accommodation, dining options, and attractions in both cities. I'll also need to consider transportation between the two cities in Pennsylvania and then back to Greer. The budget of $3,400 will guide the choices for flights, accommodations, and other expenses.\nObservation 1: Invalid Action.
