Then, I'll need to find flights from Memphis to Pennsylvania, estimate transportation costs within Pennsylvania, and find suitable accommodations, restaurants, and attractions in the chosen cities. I should start by selecting the cities in Pennsylvania.\nAction 1: CitySearch[Pennsylvania]\nObservation 1: ['State College', 'Johnstown', 'Harrisburg', 'Erie', 'Pittsburgh', 'Latrobe', 'Philadelphia', 'Lewisburg', 'Scranton']\nThought 2: Thought 2: Considering the list of cities in Pennsylvania, I should choose two cities that are popular and have a variety of attractions, dining options, and accommodations. Philadelphia and Pittsburgh are the largest cities with the most options, so I will focus on them.

I should note this information and then proceed to find a return flight from Pittsburgh to Memphis. After securing the flights, I will need to calculate the remaining budget for accommodations, dining, and attractions in both Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. It's also important to consider the cost of transportation within each city.\nAction 5: NotebookWrite[Flight to Pittsburgh]\nObservation 5: The information has been recorded in Notebook, and its index is 1.\nThought 6: Thought 6: With the flight to Pittsburgh noted, I now need to find a return flight from Pittsburgh to Memphis. Once I have this information, I can calculate the remaining budget for the trip.
