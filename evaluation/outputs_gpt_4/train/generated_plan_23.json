I will use CitySearch to find two cities in Idaho that could be interesting for the group to visit. Once I have the names of these cities, I can proceed with the rest of the planning steps.\nAction 3: CitySearch[Idaho]\nObservation 3: ['Twin Falls', 'Pocatello', 'Idaho Falls', 'Sun Valley', 'Boise', 'Lewiston']\nThought 4: Thought 4: Based on the cities available in Idaho, I should choose two cities that would offer a variety of experiences for the group. Boise, being the capital city, likely has a lot of attractions and dining options. Sun Valley is known for its outdoor activities and scenic beauty, which could provide a different experience. I will select Boise and Sun Valley as the two cities to visit. Now, I need to find a flight from San Jose to Boise for the group's departure date of March 1st, 2022.\nAction 4: FlightSearch[San Jose, Boise, 2022-03-01]\nObservation 4: Masked due to limited length.

I should also find attractions in Boise before moving on to Sun Valley.\nAction 5: NotebookWrite[Flight options to Boise on 2022-03-01]\nObservation 5: The information has been recorded in Notebook, and its index is 0.\nThought 6: Thought 6: Now that the flight to Boise is noted, I need to find suitable accommodation in Boise for the group. It should be comfortable for 7 people and within our budget. After securing accommodation, I will search for Indian and French restaurants in Boise, as the group is interested in these cuisines. Then, I'll look for attractions in Boise. Once Boise is covered, I'll repeat the process for Sun Valley and also check the travel options between Boise and Sun Valley.\nAction 6: AccommodationSearch[Boise]\nObservation 6: Masked due to limited length. Make sure the data has been written in Notebook.\nThought 7: Thought 7: From the accommodation options, I need to select one that is an entire home/apt type to comfortably accommodate all 7 group members and is within our budget.

I'll look for a mix of cultural, historical, and recreational activities to cater to diverse interests within the group.

After that, I'll search for attractions in Sun Valley. Finally, I'll check the travel options between Boise and Sun Valley. All this information will be written into the Notebook for the Planner tool to use.\nAction 12: AccommodationSearch[Sun Valley]\nObservation 12: Masked due to limited length. Make sure the data has been written in Notebook.\nThought 13: Thought 13: The accommodation options in Sun Valley seem limited for a group of 7, with only one option that can accommodate up to 10 people. However, it requires a minimum of 4 nights, which fits our 5-day itinerary. I will note this accommodation in the Notebook. Next, I need to search for Indian and French restaurants in Sun Valley. After that, I will look for attractions in Sun Valley. Once I have all the necessary information for Sun Valley, I will check the travel options between Boise and Sun Valley and write all the findings into the Notebook.\nAction 13: NotebookWrite[Accommodation options in Sun Valley]\nObservation 13: The information has been recorded in Notebook, and its index is 4.\nThought 14: Thought 14: With the accommodation for Sun Valley noted, the next step is to find restaurants serving Indian and French cuisine in Sun Valley. This might be challenging given the smaller size of the city, but it's important to try to meet the group's dining preferences. After finding the restaurants, I will search for attractions in Sun Valley to ensure a diverse itinerary. Once I have all the information for Sun Valley, I will check the travel options between Boise and Sun Valley. All this information will be written into the Notebook for the Planner tool to use.\nAction 14: RestaurantSearch[Sun Valley]\nObservation 14: Masked due to limited length.

Once all the information for Sun Valley is gathered, I can use the Planner tool to create the itinerary.\nAction 15: NotebookWrite[Indian and French restaurants in Sun Valley]\nObservation 15: The information has been recorded in Notebook, and its index is 5.\nThought 16: Thought 16: With the dining options in Sun Valley recorded, I should now find attractions in the area. I'll aim for a variety of attractions to cater to the group's interests. After noting down the attractions, I need to check the travel options between Boise and Sun Valley. This will help me understand how the group can move between the two cities and plan accordingly. Once I have all the necessary information, I can compile it using the Planner tool to create a comprehensive itinerary.\nAction 16: AttractionSearch[Sun Valley]\nObservation 16: Masked due to limited length. Make sure the data has been written in Notebook.\nThought 17: Thought 17: Since there are no attractions listed for Sun Valley, I will need to consider alternative activities or nearby attractions that the group might enjoy. Outdoor activities such as skiing or hiking might be available, depending on the season. I will write a note in the Notebook about the lack of listed attractions and consider including leisure time or self-guided exploration in Sun Valley. Next, I need to check the travel options between Boise and Sun Valley to ensure the group can travel comfortably between the two cities. Once I have all the information, I can use the Planner tool to finalize the itinerary.\nAction 17: NotebookWrite[No listed attractions in Sun Valley]\nObservation 17: The information has been recorded in Notebook, and its index is 6.\nThought 18: Thought 18: Now that I have noted the lack of listed attractions in Sun Valley, I need to determine the best way for the group to travel between Boise and Sun Valley. I will use the GoogleDistanceMatrix tool to estimate the distance, time, and cost of travel by taxi, as this might be the most convenient mode of transportation for a group of 7. Once I have this information, I will write it into the Notebook. With all the necessary details recorded, I will be ready to use the Planner tool to create the final 5-day travel itinerary for the group.\nAction 18: GoogleDistanceMatrix[Boise, Sun Valley, taxi]\nObservation 18: Masked due to limited length. Make sure the data has been written in Notebook.\nThought 19: Thought 19: The travel details between Boise and Sun Valley have been obtained, indicating a taxi ride of approximately 2 hours and 43 minutes over a distance of 249 km. The cost is also provided, which will help in budgeting for the group's transportation. I will record this information in the Notebook. With all the necessary information for both Boise and Sun Valley, including flights, accommodations, restaurants, attractions, and intercity travel, I am now ready to compile all the data using the Planner tool to create a comprehensive 5-day travel itinerary for the group.\nAction 19: NotebookWrite[Travel details between Boise and Sun Valley by taxi]\nObservation 19: The information has been recorded in Notebook, and its index is 7.\nThought 20: Thought 20: With all the required information for the trip now recorded in the Notebook, including flights, accommodations, dining options, attractions (or lack thereof in Sun Valley), and transportation details between Boise and Sun Valley, I can proceed to use the Planner tool.
