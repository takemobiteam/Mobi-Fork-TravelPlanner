Make sure the data has been written in Notebook.\nThought 20: Thought 20: After several attempts to find flights to major and smaller cities in Texas on the desired dates, it's clear that I need to either adjust the travel dates further or consider a different approach. Since the original travel dates of March 10th to March 14th, 2023, have not yielded any available flights, I will now try to find flights for a later date within the same month. If this is successful, I will then proceed with the rest of the planning process, including accommodation, dining, and attractions, while ensuring the total cost remains within the budget of $3,100.\nAction 20: FlightSearch[Orlando, Austin, 2023-03-13]\nObservation 20: Masked due to limited length.

If I find a flight, I will then have to adjust the return date accordingly and proceed with the rest of the planning process, ensuring the total cost remains within the budget. If this is still unsuccessful, I may need to consider a different state or region for the travel itinerary, or significantly adjust the travel dates beyond the original range. However, before making such a change, I will exhaust the options with the remaining major cities in Texas for the date of March 14th, 2023.\nAction 22: FlightSearch[Orlando, San Antonio, 2023-03-14]\nObservation 22: Masked due to limited length.

Before making such a decision, I will make one last attempt to find flights to other major Texas cities for March 14th, 2023. If this attempt is also unsuccessful, I will need to reassess the travel plan entirely, possibly by choosing a different state or region that is accessible within the original travel date range and budget constraints.\nAction 23: FlightSearch[Orlando, Dallas, 2023-03-14]\nObservation 23: Masked due to limited length.

Since the original date range of March 10th to March 14th, 2023, has not yielded any available flights, I will now explore the possibility of extending the travel dates beyond this range. If extending the dates is not feasible or does not result in available flights, I may need to consider planning a trip to a different state or region that can accommodate the original travel date range and budget constraints. Before making this decision, I will check for flights to Houston for March 14th, 2023, as a final attempt to find an available flight to a major city in Texas.\nAction 24: FlightSearch[Orlando, Houston, 2023-03-14]\nObservation 24: Masked due to limited length.

If I find a flight, I can then plan the itinerary around that city and possibly include nearby attractions or cities that are accessible by ground transportation. If this is still unsuccessful, I will need to reassess the travel plan entirely, possibly by choosing a different state or region that is accessible within the original travel date range and budget constraints.\nAction 25: FlightSearch[Orlando, Amarillo, 2023-03-10]\nObservation 25: Masked due to limited length.

Since flights to major and less popular cities in Texas are not available, I must either significantly change the travel dates or choose a different destination that fits within the original date range and budget. Before making this decision, I will make one last attempt to find a flight to a different Texas city for the original departure date of March 10th, 2023.
